There will be an error in the BottomFragment class. This is because I forgot to comment out 3 lines of code that were supposed to be comments and not actual code. I completed parts 1 and 2. Part 3, I completed up until the point where I had to pass the information to the top fragment with a Bundle. I wasn't sure how to pass the info from the rv and also ran out of time. I think I have a better understanding of fragments and how they work, but the XML for the top and bottom fragments was something I was stuck on. I didn't know how to put the top frag on top of bottom frag. I tried using layout weight but it didn't quite work.
